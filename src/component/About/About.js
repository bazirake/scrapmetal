        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>Under supervision of the Ministry of
           Environment, from the Law nÂ°63/2013 of 27/08/2013 determining the mission, organization and functioning of Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA), REMA reserves the legal mandate for national environmental protection, conservation, promotion and overall management, including advisory to the government on
           all matters pertinent to the environment and climate change.
           so,REma has established online scrap metal recycling management system
           which will help the reduction of srap metals which are harmful to environment as well as human health,
           so this system will act as intermediary between seller of scrap metals and buyer of scrap metals.</p>
